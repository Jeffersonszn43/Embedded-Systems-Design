## Embedded Systems Design Projects
#### Here is a repository that contains all of my projects from Embedded Systems Design.

#### For this course we used the ESP32 Wroom 32 board to complete our midterm project. The ESP32 is a series of system on a chip microcontrollers that are low-cost and low-power. The ESP32 comes with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. 

#### I created separate folders that holds all of the code to the projects that I worked on in this course. The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that was used to program the ESP32 Wroom 32 board was Arduino IDE.
